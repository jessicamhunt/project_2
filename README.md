## Project Management System (PMS)

## Proposal 

Project Team : 
    Evan,
    Jess,
    Rick

We plan to build a Project Management system. This system will be used for a landscaping company to track their revenues/expenses based on each job they perform. These will be sortable by job-sites (assuming these job-sites are recurring) and will also be sortable by the foremen running the job site. These will provide further analytics for the business owner.

Data points that will be tracked:
Tracking cost of materials used in a specific project
Tracking time spent on a specific project
Tracking number employees on the job
Tracking names of materials used on the job
Assigning each job to a job-site/foreman


##List of Features

1.) Project management tool
2.) Separate views for Manager and Foreman with different featuress
3.) Manager has features to:
        Create Jobs for foreman to put data into
        Write onto tables to adjust erroneous data and input revenue data
            Profits will be calculated based on the manager's revenue input and the foreman's expense inputs (below)
        View a table of all projects and the job performance 
        Sort by foreman and job site id
4.) Foreman has features to:
    Input expense data for their job-site including:
        Select job site worked on
        Input hours spent on job
        Input cost of materials on job
        Input # of men on job
5.) Will also show a map overlay of job sites which can be clicked to view specific job details
